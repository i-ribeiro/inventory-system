## DESCRIPTION

An inventory system mockup to test our understanding of insertion and searching of arrays. 

Efficiency was a grading criterion, so I used Arrays.sort and Arrays.binarysearch to give O(n * log * n) time complexity for insertion and searching.

I used Eclipse, Java 11, and Git to complete this assignment.

## COMPATIBILITY 

Compatible with Java 11+.

## INSTALL/BUILD

Install the latest build [here](https://github.com/i-ribeiro/inventory-system/releases/latest).

## USAGE

Follow prompts in-terminal to add items to the inventory, display current inventory, buy/sell items, or exit.
